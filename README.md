# TierPass
 A tool to tier your password based on many factors

TierPass uses [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn), a realistic password strength estimator developed by Dropbox. It returns a score from **0 (very weak)** to **4 (very strong)**, along with practical feedback and estimated crack times.
